    "# Transforming NBA Box Score Data and General Game Data\n",
    "In the last post, I went over the data source as well as the methodology for extracting NBA Data. Currently, I'm pulling play-by-play and box score data, along with all the general game data from NBA.com, player transaction data from RealGM.com, and salary data from Sportrac. Here's a quick summary of the raw data, its format, and source, as well as the two data sources that I'm going to work on transforming in this post, the Box Score data and General Game Data:\n",

    "I'm going to transform this data into a relational database, which will likely be changed/altered as time goes on. I'll provide the transformation that I plan to run for each table, and how the transformation of the source data will work. "

    "One additional piece of information I want to capture that isn't always available in the box score data is whether or not the player is active, and if they're not, the reason for their absence. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a player is \"DNP\" (did not play) it can be found in the box score, however, inactive players don't appear there. In addition, older box scores sometimes don't even list \"DNP\" players (it's unclear when exactly teams started including them, but it appears to be sometime in the mid 90s), and they definitely don't provide any information on whether or not a player was \"inactive\". For my purposes, it really doesn't matter if a player is \"inactive\" or \"DNP\", either shows that the player was on the roster and didn't play in the game, which is all I want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing this with more recent data is fairly easy because there is a nested dictionary specifically for inactive players that is populated in the data (I think it's post-2005-ish when it begins to consistently appear), however, I haven't assessed its reliability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only real method for ensuring that the data is accurate would be more complicated than what I want do do here, and would require tracking a player's start and end dates with every team, and then merging those dates with each team's game logs. This would be made even more complicated by the fact that you couldn't pull a player's start and end dates with every team from the box score data, because a player may be traded while they're injured, and technically be inactive, so wouldn't even appear in a box score well into their tenure with the team. \n",
    "\n",
    "What I think makes sense long term is to create a completely separate table for a player's status, that will contain the player's name/id, the game id, whether or not they were active or inactive, and the reason for being inactive if it's available. In order to capture this, I'd need transaction data, and full NBA game logs, which is captured in the General Game Data which I'll tackle next. In the next post I'll just concentrate on creating the player transaction table."
